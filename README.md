An exploratory data analysis of Airbnb NY dataset 2019
Airbnb New York 2019 EDA
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the 2019 Airbnb dataset for New York. The goal is to uncover insights and trends in the Airbnb listings data.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Airbnb. It includes information about Airbnb listings in New York for the year 2019.


# Analysis
This analysis includes:
Data Wrangling: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and Datatype conversions.
Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics of numerical and categorical features.
Data Visualization: Visual exploration of data through histograms, bar plots, and maps, scatter plots.
Geospatial Analysis: Mapping listings to understand geographic distribution of neighborhoods and analyse trends.
Price Analysis: Investigating pricing trends across different boroughs and room types.

# Requirements
Python 3.7+,
Jupyter Notebook,
Pandas,
NumPy,
Matplotlib,
Seaborn,
Geopandas,
Folium,
Plotly

# How to Run
 ## If using Google Colab:
        ```python
        import pandas as pd 
        import numpy as np
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        ```
        These 3 are in built-in for colab and can be imported using the above lines of code. But to use advance visualisation tools used in this project we have to install all the other dependencies in colab refering to their docs and git folders.
 ## If running the project locally using jupyter notebook:
        Then we have to install all the dependencies individually either in the jupyter notebook or locally in the system.
Basically the code is well commented describing each particular line and step and you are good to go after installing the dependencies.           

# Results
The findings from the analysis reveals various trends and insights about Airbnb listings in New York, such as average price in different neighbourhoods across the five boroughs of the New York City. It also identifies the locations mostly preferred by consumers and the average cost they can expect to incur. Additionally, it focuses on the types of accommodations preferred by people from amongst the available options, which varies on the basis of length of stay. Detailed results and visualizations are documented within the Jupyter Notebook.
